Look if you had one test or one examination 
to prove everything you ever learned, one question
would you solve it or just guess “c”
yo
his palms are sweaty, wrists sore, arms are heavy
theres vomit on his calculator, mom’s spaghetti
hes nervous, but on the surface he looks calm an
ready to use equations
but he keeps on forgetting his notecards
the whole room goes quiet
he moves his pencil, but the answers wont go down
nes nervous how, everybodys ahead now
the clocks moved on, times up: pencils down
snap back to physics, oh here comes gravity
oh there goes pulleys, he choked
hes tired, but he wont give up that easy,
NO
he wont deny it, he knows physics is life
it doesnt matter, hes lohr
he knows the challenge
hes so tired he knows
when he goes back to kinematics, thats when its
back to the labs again, yo
the whole online,
you better capture the data and hope it has no error
You better lose yourself in the physics, the moment
of inertia, you better not forget ml^2
you only get one test, do not miss your chance to solve
the opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
the energy’s escaping, through friction and sound,
this problem is mine to solve
make me king, as i start the free response normal problems boring, but only variables adds spice
it only grows harder, equations longer
time ends, its all over, the questions move around
paper to paper, hes known as the solver,
lonely onlines shnu only knows
hes grown farther from frictionless, hes no friend
he goes home and barely talks to any of them
but hold your calculator, because here comes the numbers,
his girls dont want him no more, hes a nerd
the’ve moved onto the next shmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada
i suppose its old equations, but the stress goes
ba dum ba dum ba dum ba dum
no more labs, imma change what you call easy
drop this mother loving car off like gravities changed
i was playing in the beginning, the whole lab changed
i got a y-intercept and 50% error
but ive kept solving and derived the next equation
best believe someone measured the delta d
all the error amplified by the fact
that logger pro just wont work
and i cant provide the correct answer for my group
cus man these stupid numbers are useless
and it aint no practicum, theres no help, this is my lab
and mechanics is so hard and e & m will just be harder
trying to inflate and set my grade, plus
teetor tooter caught up between being a boy friend and a physics god
hot girls drama screaming on and on
too many onlines for me to wanna
stay in this class, another day of suffering
has gotten me to the point, im like a projectile
gotta find the rage, or i am wrong or marked down
success is my only reasonable option, failures not
friends, i love you, but ive gotta go solve
i cannot forget this v vs t plot
so here i go its my shot
pencil fail me not, this may be the only test i got
you can solve anything you put your mind to man
