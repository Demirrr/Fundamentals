# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

With this collection of notebooks, I would like to share my experience of learning and researching machine learning techniques. To this end, on each notebook, the reader is firstly provided with a brief mathematical background. Therafter, I implemented techniques from scratch (rather than using APIs) in Python. 

Recreating techniques via implementing them from scratch necessiates understanding computations in atomic details. Although this is an quite laborious act, the feeling of recreating techniques is worthwhile.
