# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

With this collection of notebooks, I would like to share my experience of learning and researching machine learning techniques. To this end, on each notebook, the reader is firstly provided with a brief mathematical background knowledge. Therafter, I provided a naive Python implementation of the respective technique. During the implementation, I focused on the readability.

Recreating techniques via implementing them from scratch necessitates understanding atomic details of the respective techniques. Listen [Yann LeCun](https://youtu.be/Svb1c6AkRzE?t=693), [Yoshua Bengio](https://youtu.be/pnTLZQhFpaE?t=1269) and [Andrej Karpathy](https://youtu.be/_au3yw46lcg?t=782) can not be all wrong :)


Feel free to use/modify any code provided in this repository. However, I have a request from you.
